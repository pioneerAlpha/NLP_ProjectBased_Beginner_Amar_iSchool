# NLP Project Based Course (Beginner Level)

Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software. This includes both algorithms that take human-produced text as input and algorithms that produce natural-looking text as outputs. Statistical NLP is now strongly focused on the use of artificial intelligence to both perform inference on specific tasks and develop robust end-to-end systems. By the end of the course, one will learn the use of NLP on different end-to-end systems like a chatbot, recommender system, detection model, speech emotion recognizer, etc.
